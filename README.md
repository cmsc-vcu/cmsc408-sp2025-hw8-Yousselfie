Continuing with the theme of roleplaying as database wizards to get practice with SQL, Iâ€™ve been *hired* by the World Bank as a data analyst charged with working with the World Development Indicator database. For this assignment, I'm working with data pulled containing WDI data and being introduced to **case statements** and **CTEs (common table expressions)**.

This repo features the report.qmd file mixed with python and sql used to make the report described above.
